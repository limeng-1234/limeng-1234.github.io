This is the front page of a website that is powered by the [Academic Pages template](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io) and hosted on GitHub pages. [GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com) is a free service in which websites are built and hosted from code and data stored in a GitHub repository, automatically updating when a new commit is made to the respository. This template was forked from the [Minimal Mistakes Jekyll Theme](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/) created by Michael Rose, and then extended to support the kinds of content that academics have: publications, talks, teaching, a portfolio, blog posts, and a dynamically-generated CV. You can fork [this repository](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io) right now, modify the configuration and markdown files, add your own PDFs and other content, and have your own site for free, with no ads! An older version of this template powers my own personal website at [stuartgeiger.com](http://stuartgeiger.com), which uses [this Github repository](https://github.com/staeiou/staeiou.github.io).

About me
======
I am currently a PhD candidate in Control Science and Engineering at Tongji University, expected to graduate in 2024 under the supervision of Professor Chen Hong. 

Research Interests:
======
My research focuses on explainable methods for learning-based autonomous driving decisions and end-to-end autonomous driving systems.

Education Background:
======
I obtained my Bachelor's degree in Electrical Engineering and Automation from Changchun University of Science and Technology, from 2013 to 2017.
Subsequently, I pursued my Master's degree in Control Science and Engineering at Jilin University, from 2017 to 2020, under the guidance of Professor Gao Jinwu.
Currently, I am pursuing my Ph.D. in Control Science and Engineering at Tongji University, since 2020.



Project Experience:
======
National Key R&D Program Sub-project: Trustworthy and Explainable Mixed Human-Machine Intelligent Decision-Making and Online Evaluation for Autonomous Driving: I am a key contributor to this project, focusing on the development of explainable autonomous driving decision algorithms. I have implemented feature attribution methods based on Shapley values to enhance the credibility of data-driven autonomous driving models.
National Key R&D Program Sub-project: Key Technologies for Self-Evolving Learning-Based Autonomous Driving Systems: I am actively involved in developing explainable vehicle intention prediction algorithms. I have proposed a counterfactual model diagnosis approach guided by feature attribution to improve the reliability of data-driven vehicle intention models.
National Key R&D Program Sub-project: Research on Key Technologies and Platform Development for High Power Density Fuel Cell Engines: As a participant, I was responsible for modeling and designing decoupling controllers for nonlinear fuel cell systems. I utilized feedback linearization techniques and implemented robust decoupling control for fuel cell air supply systems.
Dongfeng Motor Corporation Project: Robotaxi Autonomous Vehicle Technology Development: I contributed to the development of autonomous driving system planning and control algorithms, establishing a virtual-real combined testing platform, and conducting real-vehicle experiments.
Publication Record:
