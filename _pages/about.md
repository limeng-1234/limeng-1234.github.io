I am currently a PhD candidate in Control Science and Engineering at Tongji University, expected to graduate in 2024 under the supervision of Professor Chen Hong. You can also find my CV here [Li Meng's Curriculum Vitae](../assets/curriculum_vitae.pdf).

Research Interests
======
My research focuses on explainable methods for learning-based autonomous driving decisions and end-to-end autonomous driving systems.

Education Background
======
I obtained my Bachelor's degree in Electrical Engineering and Automation from Changchun University of Science and Technology, from 2013 to 2017.
Subsequently, I pursued my Master's degree in Control Science and Engineering at Jilin University, from 2017 to 2020, under the guidance of Professor Gao Jinwu.
Currently, I am pursuing my Ph.D. in Control Science and Engineering at Tongji University, since 2020.



Project Experience
======

### National Key R&D Program Sub-project: Trustworthy and Explainable Mixed Human-Machine Intelligent Decision-Making and Online Evaluation for Autonomous Driving (Sep. 2020 - Present)
I am a key contributor to this project, focusing on the development of explainable autonomous driving decision algorithms. I have implemented feature attribution methods based on Shapley values to enhance the credibility of data-driven autonomous driving models.

### National Key R&D Program Sub-project: Key Technologies for Self-Evolving Learning-Based Autonomous Driving Systems (Sep. 2022 - Present)

 I am actively involved in developing explainable vehicle intention prediction algorithms. I have proposed a counterfactual model diagnosis approach guided by feature attribution to improve the reliability of data-driven vehicle intention models.
###  National Key R&D Program Sub-project: Research on Key Technologies and Platform Development for High Power Density Fuel Cell Engines (Jan. 2018 - Dec. 2020)

As a participant, I was responsible for modeling and designing decoupling controllers for nonlinear fuel cell systems. I utilized feedback linearization techniques and implemented robust decoupling control for fuel cell air supply systems.
### Dongfeng Motor Corporation Project: Robotaxi Autonomous Vehicle Technology Development  (Dec. 2020 - Dec. 2021)

I contributed to the development of autonomous driving system planning and control algorithms, establishing a virtual-real combined testing platform, and conducting real-vehicle experiments.
