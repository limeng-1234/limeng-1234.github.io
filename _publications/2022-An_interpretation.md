title: "An interpretation framework for autonomous vehicles decision-making via SHAP and RF"
collection: publications
category: conferences
permalink: /publication/2009-10-01-paper-title-number-1
excerpt: 'This paper proposes a method that combines SHAP and RF to address the transparency issue in deep reinforcement learning (DRL) for autonomous vehicle decision-making. By implementing this approach, it aims to achieve safe and efficient driving decisions while also providing explanations for the behavioral outcomes of these decisions.'
