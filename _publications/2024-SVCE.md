collection: publications
category: manuscripts
permalink: /publication/2009-10-01-paper-title-number-1
excerpt: 'This article proposes a feature contribution guided counterfactual explanation (CE) generation framework based on Shapley values, which addresses the issue of suboptimal and biased explanations in traditional counterfactual explanation methods for complex machine learning models, particularly in safety-critical domains like autonomous driving.'
